        We created BookHub because we love stories.  Since the beginning of civilization, stories were created

    <h3 class="arial">Connecting People</h3>
    <p class="arial">This is a place holder for an explanation on how BookHub connects likeminded individuals

    <h3 class="arial">Encouraging Future Authors</h3>
    <p class="arial">
        This a place holder for how BookHub can connect readers with new or unpublished authors, and authors
        can connect with their community and build a name for themselves.
    </p>
    <h3 class="arial">Reading for Everyone</h3>
    <p class="arial">
        This is a place holder for how BookHub can provide a resource for free reading materials, access to audiobooks,
        partnerships with local and online libraries, and nonprofits to increase access both online and in schools.
